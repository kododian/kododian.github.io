# Welcome ðŸ‘‹ {.unnumbered}

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
Twelve years ago, two researchers proposed a provocative idea: that the genetic code may carry an embedded signal of non-evolutionary origin.

Their work sparked intrigue â€” and resistance.

This book revisits the findings of V.&nbsp;sh'Cherbak and M.&nbsp;Makukov with a fresh perspective and a new approach. As a seasoned software engineer and independent researcher in data science and bioinformatics, I present compelling new evidence â€” evidence that fills a critical gap in their theory and, I argue, settles the case for an embedded signal in the genetic code once and for all.

Whether youâ€™re a scientist, skeptic, or simply curious â€” I invite you to examine the signal for yourself.
